**User management system for a team of space-colonists** 
**Node.js Web Application with Angular**

I have learned the basics of front end development. I used javascript, the Angular framework. 
I have also learned how to use libraries in a project (I implemented components from NgZorro in this project).
I used a "fake backend" that is a json file with the data I used for the webpage.
I implemented login and registration fatures using Reqres to simulate server interactions.

In this project I aimed to create a space-colonists team management system. Users can create their own team and choose diverse ships from the garage.
It is my first project that offered me an introduction into the world of web development.

-----------------------------------------
For the project to run (Node.js needs to be installed):
1. Inside root folder of project, run the command "npm install", to install node packages for the project
2. Then run "json-server --watch db.json" to connect to the 'fake backend server' (the .json file) 
3. For login or register, use address "eve.holt@reqres.in"; any password will work


For authentication, I utilized https://reqres.in/ for testing HTTP requests and responses during the development of the login and registration functionalities.
