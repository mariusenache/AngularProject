**Node.js Web Application with Angular**

I have learned the basics of front end development. I used javascript, the Angular framework. 
I have also learned how to use libraries in a project (I implemented components from NgZorro in this project).
I used a "fake backend" that is a json file with the data I used for the webpage.
I implemented login and registration fatures using Reqres to simulate server interactions.

In this project I aimed to replicate the initial page of a spaceship game. On this page, users can create their own team and choose ships from the garage for an immersive space gaming experience.
It is my first project that offered me an introduction into the world of web development.
